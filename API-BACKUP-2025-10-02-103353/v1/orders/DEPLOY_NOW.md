# Orders API - DEPLOY THESE FILES

## ✅ Files to Upload

### UPLOAD THESE 2 FILES to `/lg/API/v1/orders/`:

1. **index.php** - Main orders API (uses same auth as profile.php)
2. **.htaccess** - Routes requests to index.php

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

1. **Upload both files** to your server at `/lg/API/v1/orders/`
2. **Test the API** (make sure you're logged into the React app first)
3. **Check the Orders tab** - should now display orders

## 🧪 How to Verify It's Working

1. Log into your React app
2. Open Browser DevTools (F12) → Network Tab
3. Click on Profile → Orders tab
4. Look for API call to `/orders/my-orders`
5. Should return JSON with orders data

## 📋 What This Fixes

- Uses the SAME authentication system as profile.php (which works)
- Reads from your existing Orders table (98,473 orders confirmed)
- Returns data in the format expected by React app
- Handles both JWT tokens and PHP sessions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This uses `UID` column for user ID (matching your Orders table structure)
- Authentication is handled by the same middleware as profile.php
- No database changes needed - uses existing Orders and OrderItems tables

## 🔍 API Endpoints

- `GET /orders/my-orders` - Returns all orders for logged-in user
- `GET /orders/{order_id}` - Returns specific order details with items

The authentication works exactly like your profile endpoint that's already functioning correctly!
