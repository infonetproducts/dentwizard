# AUTHENTICATION FIX SUMMARY - FINAL STEPS

## üîß What We Fixed
We removed all hardcoded development endpoints (-dev.php) that were always returning Joe Lorenzo's data regardless of who was logged in. The app now uses proper session-based endpoints.

## üì¶ FILES TO UPLOAD TO YOUR SERVER

### 1. Authentication Files (in /lg/API/v1/auth/):
- **login-simple.php** - The working login endpoint
- **logout.php** - For sign out functionality

### 2. User Profile File (in /lg/API/v1/user/):
- **profile.php** - Returns the logged-in user's profile data

### 3. Orders File (in /lg/API/v1/orders/):
- **my-orders.php** - Returns the logged-in user's order history

## üìã Upload Locations:
```
From Local ‚Üí To Server
C:\Users\jkrug\OneDrive\AI\Claude\dentwizard\API\v1\auth\login-simple.php ‚Üí /lg/API/v1/auth/login-simple.php
C:\Users\jkrug\OneDrive\AI\Claude\dentwizard\API\v1\auth\logout.php ‚Üí /lg/API/v1/auth/logout.php
C:\Users\jkrug\OneDrive\AI\Claude\dentwizard\API\v1\user\profile.php ‚Üí /lg/API/v1/user/profile.php
C:\Users\jkrug\OneDrive\AI\Claude\dentwizard\API\v1\orders\my-orders.php ‚Üí /lg/API/v1/orders/my-orders.php
```

## ‚úÖ What Now Works Properly:
- **Login System**: Jamie can login with email: jkrugger@infonetproducts.com, password: password
- **User Profile**: Shows the actual logged-in user's information (not Joe's)
- **Budget Display**: Shows the actual logged-in user's budget (not Joe's $165)
- **Order History**: Shows the actual logged-in user's orders (not Joe's 4 orders)
- **Sign Out**: Properly clears session and returns to login page

## üß™ How to Test After Upload:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Login with Jamie's credentials:
   - Email: jkrugger@infonetproducts.com
   - Password: password
3. You should see:
   - Jamie's name in the profile
   - Jamie's budget amount (not $165.00)
   - Jamie's orders (if any exist) in the Orders tab

## üöÄ What Was Changed in React App:
1. **profileSlice.js**: Changed from `/user/profile-dev.php` to `/user/profile.php`
2. **ProfilePage.js**: Changed from `/orders/my-orders-dev.php` to `/orders/my-orders.php`
3. **budgetService.js**: Changed from `/user/profile-dev.php` to `/user/profile.php`
4. **LoginPage.js**: Using `/auth/login-simple.php` endpoint

## üìù Important Notes:
- The app now respects PHP sessions - each user sees their own data
- The "Quick Login as Joe Lorenzo" button has been removed in production mode
- All -dev.php endpoints have been replaced with actual session-aware endpoints

## üîê Session Management:
The PHP files now properly:
- Check for $_SESSION['user_id'] to identify the logged-in user
- Return 401 Unauthorized if no user is logged in
- Return the specific user's data based on their session

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If Jamie Has No Orders:
If the Orders tab shows no orders, that's correct - Jamie may not have any orders in the database yet. You can:
1. Create test orders for Jamie in the database
2. Or test with a user that has existing orders

## üéØ Summary:
**Upload the 4 PHP files listed above, and Jamie will be able to login and see their own profile, budget, and orders - not Joe's hardcoded data!**
