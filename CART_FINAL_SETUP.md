# Cart Implementation Final Setup

## ‚úÖ Development (Working Now)

Your cart is configured with proxy for local development:
- API calls to `/lg/API/v1/*` are proxied to `https://dentwizard.lgstore.com`
- Sessions work because everything appears same-origin
- No CORS issues

### To Test:
1. **Restart React app:** `npm start`
2. **Clear browser storage** (F12 ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Clear site data)
3. **Test cart:**
   - Add product to cart
   - Cart icon should show count
   - Cart page should show items

## üöÄ Production Setup for Render

### When you deploy to Render:

1. **Update your .env.production:**
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://dentwizard.lgstore.com/lg/API/v1
```

2. **Update cart.php on your server:**
Replace with `cart-with-cors.php` and add your Render domain to the allowed origins:
```php
$allowed_origins = array(
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'https://your-app.onrender.com'  // ‚Üê Add your actual Render URL
);
```

3. **Build for production:**
```bash
npm run build
```

## üìÇ File Reference

### Development Files:
- `/react-app/package.json` - Has proxy configured
- `/react-app/src/services/api.js` - Uses proxy in dev, env variable in production

### Production Files:
- `/API/v1/cart/cart.php` - Current working cart
- `/API/v1/cart/cart-with-cors.php` - Version with CORS for Render (use this in production)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If cart doesn't work in development:
1. Make sure React app was restarted after proxy added
2. Clear all browser storage
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify API is accessible at https://dentwizard.lgstore.com

### If cart doesn't work on Render:
1. Verify CORS header includes your Render domain
2. Check browser console for CORS errors
3. Ensure credentials are being sent
4. Check PHP error logs

## üìã Quick Checklist

### Development ‚úì
- [x] Proxy configured in package.json
- [x] API service uses correct baseURL
- [x] Cart operations use cart.php
- [ ] Test add to cart
- [ ] Test cart persistence
- [ ] Test quantity updates

### Production (When Ready)
- [ ] Update .env.production with API URL
- [ ] Add Render domain to CORS allowed origins
- [ ] Upload cart-with-cors.php
- [ ] Test on Render deployment

## Summary

You're using the **proxy solution** for development (simple, works now) and will add **CORS headers** for production (minimal PHP changes). This is the most practical approach with least complexity.
