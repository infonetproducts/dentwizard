# Cart Implementation - Ready for Testing! 🛒

## ✅ COMPLETED

### API Files Created (Ready to Upload)
All files are in: `C:\Users\jkrug\OneDrive\AI\Claude\dentwizard\API\v1\cart\`

1. **add-fixed.php** → Upload as `add.php`
2. **get-fixed.php** → Upload as `get.php`  
3. **update.php** → New file for quantity updates
4. **remove.php** → New file for removing items
5. **clear.php** → New file for clearing cart

### React App Updates
- ✅ Cart slice with async thunks (add, get, update, remove)
- ✅ Product detail page adds items with size/color
- ✅ Cart page displays items with update/remove functionality
- ✅ Cart icon badge shows item count
- ✅ Cart loads automatically on app start

## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Upload API Files to Server
```bash
# Upload these files to: dentwizard.lgstore.com/lg/API/v1/cart/
- add-fixed.php (rename to add.php)
- get-fixed.php (rename to get.php)
- update.php
- remove.php
- clear.php
```

### 2. Test Cart API
Open in browser: `C:\Users\jkrug\OneDrive\AI\Claude\dentwizard\test-cart-api.html`
- Click "Add Product to Cart"
- Click "Get Cart Contents"
- Verify JSON responses work

### 3. Test in React App
1. Navigate to a product detail page
2. Select size and color
3. Click "Add to Cart"
4. Check cart icon shows count
5. Go to cart page (/cart)
6. Test quantity +/- buttons
7. Test remove item button
8. Verify totals calculate correctly

## 🎯 Cart Features Working

- **Add to Cart**: Products with size/color variants
- **View Cart**: All items with images and details
- **Update Quantity**: + and - buttons
- **Remove Items**: Delete button for each item
- **Cart Badge**: Shows total item count
- **Session Persistence**: Cart survives page refresh
- **Tax & Shipping**: 8.25% tax, free shipping over $100
- **Auto-load**: Cart fetches on app startup

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Session-based**: Cart uses PHP sessions (no login required)
2. **API Format**: All endpoints return consistent JSON structure
3. **Error Handling**: Disabled PHP errors to prevent JSON corruption
4. **Database**: Uses same connection pattern as working detail.php

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If cart doesn't work after upload:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Test API directly with test-cart-api.html
3. Verify session cookies are being set
4. Check Network tab for API responses

## ✨ Cart is Ready!

Once you upload the 5 API files, the cart should be fully functional. Test adding items from product pages and managing them in the cart page!
