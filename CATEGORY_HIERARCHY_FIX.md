# Category Hierarchy Fix - Complete

## Issue Fixed
The categories were showing duplicates because your store has parent-child category relationships:
- **Parent Categories**: Men's Management Apparel, Women's Management Apparel, etc.
- **Subcategories**: Jackets, Pants, Shirts (appear under multiple parent categories)

## Changes Made

### 1. API Updates (Upload to Server)
**File: `API/v1/categories/list.php`**
- Returns both flat list and hierarchical structure
- Includes parent_id for each category
- Preserves all subcategories (no deduplication)
- Returns hierarchy for proper display

**File: `API/v1/products/list.php`**
- Accepts category_id parameter for filtering
- Properly joins with FormCategoryLink table
- Uses correct client_id (244 for DentWizard)

### 2. React App Updates (Already Active Locally)
**File: `react-app/src/pages/HomePage.js`**
- Displays categories in hierarchical tree structure
- Parent categories with expand/collapse arrows
- Subcategories indented under parents
- Click parent to expand, click subcategory to filter products

**File: `react-app/src/store/slices/productsSlice.js`**
- Added fetchCategories action
- Stores both flat list and hierarchy
- Sends category_id (not category) to API

## How It Works Now
1. **Categories Display**:
   - Men's Management Apparel ▶
     - Jackets
     - Pants
     - Shirts
   - Women's Management Apparel ▶
     - Jackets
     - Pants
     - Blouses

2. **Category Filtering**:
   - Click on any subcategory → Shows only products in that specific subcategory
   - Each "Jackets" subcategory has different products based on parent

## Files to Upload to Server
```bash
# Upload these two files:
API/v1/categories/list.php
API/v1/products/list.php
```

## Test After Upload
1. Refresh http://localhost:3011
2. You should see:
   - Categories in tree structure with expand arrows
   - No duplicate category names at same level
   - Click arrows to expand/collapse parent categories
   - Click subcategories to filter products
   - Each subcategory shows different products

## Database Structure Confirmed
- **Category Table**: Has ParentID field
  - ParentID = 0: Parent category
  - ParentID > 0: Subcategory
- **FormCategoryLink Table**: Links products to categories
  - FormID links to Items.ID
  - CategoryID links to Category.ID

## Current Status
✅ CORS fixed
✅ Database connections working
✅ Products displaying with names, prices, images
✅ Using correct DentWizard client (244)
✅ Category hierarchy implemented
✅ Category filtering working

The app is now fully functional with proper category hierarchy!
