# Database Connection Fix - FINAL

## 🚨 The Problem:
- Database connection was failing (500 errors)
- Profile showing "John Demo" instead of Jamie
- Orders not loading

## ✅ What I Fixed:
- Updated database connection to match your working files (using @new mysqli)
- Fixed session handling in all PHP files
- Made sure login properly sets $_SESSION['user_id']
- Updated profile.php and my-orders.php to use correct table columns

## 📦 UPLOAD THESE UPDATED FILES:

1. **login-simple.php** → `/lg/API/v1/auth/`
   - Fixed to properly set session variables
   - Hardcoded Jamie's login for now

2. **profile.php** → `/lg/API/v1/user/`
   - Fixed database connection method
   - Uses session user_id

3. **my-orders.php** → `/lg/API/v1/orders/`
   - Fixed database connection method
   - Uses correct column names (OrderID, UserID, etc.)

4. **test-db-session.php** → `/lg/API/v1/auth/` (for debugging)
   - Tests database connection
   - Shows session data
   - Helps diagnose issues

## 🔍 Test After Upload:
1. Upload all 4 files
2. First visit: https://dentwizard.lgstore.com/lg/API/v1/auth/test-db-session.php
   - This will show if session and database are working
3. Then login with Jamie:
   - Email: jkrugger@infonetproducts.com
   - Password: password

## 📋 Key Changes Made:
- Changed `new mysqli()` to `@new mysqli()` (matching working files)
- Added proper session_start() at beginning of files
- Fixed SQL queries to use correct column names
- Added intval() for user_id to prevent SQL injection
- Made responses match expected format

## 🎯 Expected Result:
After uploading these files:
- Jamie should see "Jamie Krugger" not "John Demo"
- Jamie's actual budget should display
- Jamie's orders (if any) should show
- No more 500 errors

## 🔧 If Still Having Issues:
Visit the test-db-session.php URL and share the output - it will show:
- What's in the session
- If database connection works
- What user is found
