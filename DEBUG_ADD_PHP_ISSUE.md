# 🔍 DEEP DEBUG NEEDED

Since all individual components work but add.php still fails, let's debug systematically:

## 🧪 Upload These Test Files:

### 1. **add-test-basic.php** (3 lines only!)
```php
<?php
echo json_encode(array('success' => true, 'test' => 'basic'));
?>
```
Upload as: `/lg/API/v1/cart/add.php`
- If this fails, there's a server configuration issue with add.php specifically

### 2. **add-debug-steps.php** 
Upload as: `/lg/API/v1/cart/add-debug-steps.php`
- Shows exactly which step fails
- Run with: `test-cart-debug.html` (click "Test Raw add.php Output")

### 3. **add-bare-minimum.php**
- Exact copy of working get.php structure
- Just returns success

## 🤔 Possible Server Issues:

1. **File permissions** - Maybe add.php has different permissions
2. **.htaccess rules** - Maybe there's a rewrite rule affecting add.php
3. **ModSecurity** - Some servers block POST to files named "add"
4. **PHP handler** - Different handling for add.php

## 🎯 TEST NOW:

1. First upload **add-test-basic.php** as add.php
   - This is only 3 lines - it MUST work
   - If it fails, the problem is the server, not the code

2. Try renaming the file on server:
   - Upload add-simplest.php as **cart-add.php** instead
   - Update your test to use cart-add.php

3. Check server logs:
   - Ask your hosting provider for PHP error logs
   - There might be a specific error we can't see

## 💡 Alternative Solution:

If add.php keeps failing, we could:
1. Use a different filename like `cart-add.php`
2. Route everything through a single `cart.php` with action parameter
3. Use the existing working ajax_cart.php from lg_files

Let me know what happens with the 3-line test file!
