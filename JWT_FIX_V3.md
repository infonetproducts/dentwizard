# JWT.PHP FIX - Version 3

## Error Fixed:
```
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected 'use' (T_USE) in jwt.php on line 12
```

## Problem:
PHP doesn't allow `use` statements inside conditional blocks or after other code. They must be at the file's top level, but if we put them at the top and Firebase JWT isn't installed, we get another error!

## Solution:
**Removed all `use` statements** and instead use fully qualified class names (with backslashes).

### Changed From:
```php
use Firebase\JWT\JWT;  // This causes error!
// ...later...
JWT::encode($payload, $key);
```

### Changed To:
```php
// No use statements at all!
// ...later...
\Firebase\JWT\JWT::encode($payload, $key);  // Fully qualified name
```

## Upload This Fixed Version:

The fixed `jwt.php` now:
- âœ… NO `use` statements (avoids parse error)
- âœ… Works WITHOUT Firebase JWT installed (falls back to simple token)
- âœ… PHP 5.6 compatible syntax
- âœ… Handles both JWT v5 and v6 if installed

## For Your Developer:

1. **Upload the newly fixed jwt.php** from:
   ```
   C:\Users\jkrug\OneDrive\AI\Claude\dentwizard\API\config\jwt.php
   ```
   
   To:
   ```
   /home/rwaf/public_html/lg/API/config/jwt.php
   ```

2. **Test again:**
   ```bash
   curl https://dentwizard.lgstore.com/lg/API/v1/products/list.php?client_id=244&limit=2
   ```

## Why This Keeps Happening:

PHP has strict rules about `use` statements:
- Must be at top of file
- Cannot be conditional
- Cannot be after other code (except declare)
- Will error if class doesn't exist

By NOT using `use` statements and using full class paths instead, we avoid all these issues!

## This Should Finally Work! ðŸ¤ž
