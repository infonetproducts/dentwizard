# UI Changes - January 17, 2025

## Changes Made:

### 1. Removed Products Button from Navigation
**File:** `src/components/layout/Layout.js`

**What was removed:**
- Products button from desktop navigation bar
- Products item from mobile drawer menu
- Shop button from mobile bottom navigation
- Updated navigation indices after removal

**Why:** User requested removal of the unnecessary Products button from all pages.

### 2. Removed Hardcoded Product Details Section  
**File:** `src/pages/ProductDetailPage.js`

**What was removed:**
- Static "Product Details" section with hardcoded bullet points:
  - 100% Polyester performance fabric
  - Moisture-wicking and breathable
  - Machine washable
  - Embroidered logo

**Why:** This content was hardcoded and didn't reflect actual product data. Product descriptions should come from the API/database only.

## Navigation Structure After Changes:

### Desktop Navigation:
- Home
- Cart icon (with badge)
- Profile icon

### Mobile Bottom Navigation:
- Home
- Cart (with badge)
- Profile

### Mobile Drawer Menu:
- Home
- Cart
- Profile

## Testing:
After these changes:
1. Products button no longer appears in any navigation
2. Product detail pages only show actual product description from API
3. All navigation still functions properly to access products through home page categories

## Files Backed Up:
- Layout.js - Navigation component with Products removed
- ProductDetailPage.js - Product detail page without hardcoded content
