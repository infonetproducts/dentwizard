// Copy your working cart.php and just add this ONE LINE in the 'add' case:

// In the 'add' case, after getting the input parameters, add:
$image_param = isset($input['image']) ? $input['image'] : '';

// Then when building the cart item array, change the image line to:
'image' => !empty($image_param) ? $image_param : $image_url

// That's it! The rest stays exactly the same as your working version.
