## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

### 1. Complete CheckoutPage.js
The file is partially written. To complete it:
- The current file has the basic structure
- You may need to manually add the remaining UI components
- Or restore from CheckoutPage.js.backup and modify

### 2. Deploy PHP Endpoints
Copy files from `php-api-endpoints/` to your server:
```
tax_calculate.php → /lg/API/v1/tax/calculate.php
shipping_methods.php → /lg/API/v1/shipping/methods.php  
user_budget.php → /lg/API/v1/user/budget.php
```

### 3. Configure TaxJar
Add your TaxJar API credentials to the PHP backend configuration

### 4. Test the Flow
1. Add items to cart
2. Go to checkout
3. Enter shipping address → Tax should calculate
4. Select shipping method → Cost should update
5. Review budget (if applicable)
6. Complete order
