## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Next Steps

### SSO Implementation:
- ✅ Frontend complete and ready
- ⚠️ Backend PHP files need manual deployment to server
- ⚠️ Database migration must be run
- ⚠️ Azure AD configuration required (coordination with DentWizard IT)
- ⚠️ Composer dependencies need installation on server

**Recommendation**: Deploy frontend first, test standard login still works, then deploy backend files in coordination with Azure AD setup.

### Order Cancellation:
- ⚠️ Backend endpoint `/orders/cancel.php` needs to be created
- Should validate order belongs to user
- Should check order is in "NEW" status
- Should refund budget atomically with status update
- Should log cancellation with reason

### PA Tax Exemption (Not in this deployment):
- 📝 Documented but not implemented
- Requires database schema update
- Requires backend tax calculation changes
- Can be addressed in future deployment

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "C:\Users\jkrug\OneDrive\AI\Claude\dentwizard\react-app"

# Check current branch
git branch

# View uncommitted changes
git status
```

### Step 2: Commit Uncommitted Changes
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: SSO implementation, cart fixes, order cancellation, mobile nav enhancements"
```

### Step 3: Push to Staging Branch
```bash
# Switch to staging branch
git checkout staging

# Merge from master (or current branch)
git merge master

# Push to remote
git push origin staging
```

### Step 4: Verify Render Deployment
- Render will auto-deploy on push to staging branch
- Monitor deployment at: https://dashboard.render.com/static/srv-d3fdd0l6ubrc73a2ickg
- Build time: ~2-3 minutes
- URL: https://dentwizard-app-staging.onrender.com

### Step 5: Smoke Test
1. Visit staging URL
2. Test standard login
3. Test cart operations
4. Test mobile menu
5. Check console for errors

### Step 6: Backend Deployment (Separate Task)
- Deploy SSO PHP files to `/lg/API/v1/auth/`
- Run database migration
- Install Composer dependencies
- Configure .env file
- Test SSO flow

---

## 📈 Success Criteria

### Frontend Deployment Success:
- ✅ Site loads without errors
- ✅ Standard login works
- ✅ Cart operations functional
- ✅ Orders can be placed
- ✅ Mobile navigation works
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Build completes successfully

### SSO Success (After Backend Deployment):
- ✅ Email detection works
- ✅ Microsoft button appears for @dentwizard.com
- ✅ Password field appears for non-DW emails
- ✅ SAML redirect to Azure AD works
- ✅ Callback handling works
- ✅ JWT token generation works
- ✅ User logged in successfully

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered:

```bash
# 1. Revert staging branch to previous commit
git checkout staging
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push -f origin staging

# 2. Or revert specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin staging
```

**Render will auto-deploy the rollback.**

## 📝 Notes

1. **SSO is additive**: Existing users continue working as before
2. **Cart fixes are critical**: Should be tested immediately
3. **Mobile nav is cosmetic**: Low risk, high user value
4. **Order cancellation needs backend**: Frontend ready, backend TODO
5. **Free shipping is UI-only**: Backend still returns $10, frontend shows Free
